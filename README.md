# SUIF - Spelis's Unefficient Image Format

* stored in json (bad)
* takes up more space than any other format (very bad)
* just bad in general (on purpose) (super bad)
* about 3167% bigger than PNG (extremely bad)
* i dont know what this would be useful for but it takes up space so thats fun :)

## using: 

### what you need:
* [Python](https://python.org/downloads/)
* pip (installed with python)
* pillow (install by running `pip install pillow`)

### converting to suif
* run `python main.py to {path to image} {output path}`

### converting from suif
